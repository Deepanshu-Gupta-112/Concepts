1. Variable is created in heap memory.
2. Heap is relatively large.
3. Memory has no name.
4. We have to delete the variable.
5.Run time memory allocation.

OPERATOR
new operator:-Its create a variable using DMA head memory.It will return address.
Ex- int *a =new int;
a is static in this.
to store value we have to write *a=10;

to make array using new
int *a=new int[n];

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
   int *a=new int;
   *a=10;
   cout<<*a<<endl;
   int n;
   cin>>n;
   int *arr=new int[n]; //create an array of size 10
   for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
   cin>>*(arr+i)<<"";
   cin>>arr[i];  // will also work
   }
   return 0;
   }
   
   
   delete operator
   syntax:- delete a;
   a=  NULL;
