Class:-A group of functions and variable bundle in a single unit. 
Syntax:- 
class Classn_name{
private: .. by default everything are private in class
  int marks:   can't access outside of class.
public:  
       char * name;
       int rollno;
       float weight;
       // getter function
       int getmarks(){
       return marks;
       }
       // setter function
       void setMarks(int m){
       marks=m;
       }
};
// calling getters
s.getmarks();
Getter and Setter:- If we make variable private then we use them.
int main(){
  student s; // object of a class
  char arr[100]="mohit";
  s.name=arr; // setting name of s object
  s.weight=70.5;
  s.rollno=1;
  // to print
  cout<<s.name<< " "<<s.weight<<" "<<s.rollno; 
}
 class function:- It is common to all the object of a class;
 class variable:- Different to each object and will have a diff. copy;
 
 Constructor:- create object of a class function of can't create object of a class. If 
 you don't create  a constructor a class then will automatic construction called default 
 construction;
 
 Default Constuctor:- There is no return type and name is same as class name;
 student()
 {
 }
 
 parameterized constructor:- There is no return type and name is same as class name;
 student(char arr[],float,int r){
 }
 //calling of constructor
 student s1(arr,65,1);
 
 Copy Constructor:-when we have a constructor s1 with properties(deepanshu,12,4th) and we 
 want another constructor s2 with same properties. Then it is used.
 Student(student s1){
 name=s1.name;
 rollno=s1.rollno;
 marks=s1.marks;
 
 //calling 
 student s2(s1)
 }
